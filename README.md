# Lab 8 - Starter
1) They should be fit within a Github action that runs whenver code is pushed.  
   If manually rununing locally, we won't be able to tell if the code works  
   fine remotely. If only running after completing development, we won't be  
   able to tell which piece of code is causing the bug.  
2) No.  
3) No, because message feature might include large amounts of function interactions  
   which cannot be dealed with by a unit test.  
4) Yes, because max message length might only required simple testing for a single  
   function.
